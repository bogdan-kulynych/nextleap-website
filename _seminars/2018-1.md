[NetCommons](https://netcommons.eu/) and [NextLeap](/), two EU-funded research project working on alternative networks and encryption, are convening a discussion on alternative Internet infrastructures.

Many groups across the world are trying to build technical infrastructures, be they telecom networks, access provision services or hosting and other online services, that foster decentralization and defend human rights. In that respect, they build "alternative Internets" that embody spaces of autonomy and resistance to hegemonic players in the digital realm. In this workshop, we are gathering activist and researchers to discuss the state of play, reflect on the success and failures of the "alternet movement" and lay out strategies that can help it grow and flourish in the coming years.

We will ask 2-3 participants to prepare seed talks before opening the discussion, for each of the following topics :
- Economic models
- Legal and regulatory needs
- Development strategy (politics)
