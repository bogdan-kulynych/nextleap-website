This session is dedicated to examining the ways digital technologies may re-invent territories as local open systems in a contributory economy. Decentralized and crypto-based technologies (architecture, protocols, data and metadata formats, communication systems, certification systems, blockchain systems) are raising important questions that will be confronted to the context of the Plaine Commune territory (Paris North), in an attempt to evaluate capacitative technological solutions with and for citizens. How should the global dimension of Internet communication be combined with the needs of local communities within the context of open communication systems in a way that provides clear rules for decision making and traceability of exchanges? Do decentralized systems show evidence of a new articulation between top-down and bottom-up knowledge production that could open the way to a new democratic context? How can decentralized systems help to build a new contributory economy for the benefit of local communities and contributory democracies, for example, by initiating debate concerning the definition of economic value and the context of the future of work in the age of a generalized automation of jobs and a massive decrease of employment?

To understand the prospect of decentralized, and therein singularly localizable, digital network architectures, we must start from the question of the right to secrecy evoked in the introduction, and of the ‘locality’ of singularities that this assumes. And it is from the same starting point that we must understand the necessity of the ability to access encryption technologies, for all groups gathered together within a process of collective individuation and gathered by the sharing of rules that are specific to them and thereby singular, but that are also preserved within the framework of legal rules. Through this, collective abilities can be cultivated: the capacity to conduct singular interpretations of this legal framework, and, more generally, of the whole social context that enables its evolution in the form of all kinds of knowledge. All these considerations mean that the digital should not just preserve the existing rights of citizens: it will eventually require a redefinition of citizenship itself, specifically requiring new understandings of the notions of public, private, transparency and secrecy.

These very general principles lead to defining a right to the secret as, more generally, a right to the plural individuation of those psychic individuals and collective individuals gathered together in the city as a space homogenized by the sharing of a code – but where this code, inasmuch as it is designed to accommodate the heterogeneity of singularities that are themselves neither encodable nor calculable, is itself interpretable. In this regard, we will start from Lawrence Lessig’s text ‘Code is Law’, in order to evaluate the stakes and the limits of a decentralized conception of data architecture and of a right to secrecy founded on the secret of code itself. Law as code is what enables psychic and collective individuation as the metastable composition of singularities and the groups within which they locally aggregate and individuate themselves.
