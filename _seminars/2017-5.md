Certification is a key issue in information systems but is also raising important epistemological questions since any knowledge needs to be confronted with the question of truth or more precisely of different regimes of veridiction in Foucault’s sense. This philosophical question, the ‘truth’ of the digital, will be analyzed in the context of decentralized certification, where there is no top-down or natural concept of truth but a dynamic elaboration of it. In the context of such ‘decentralization of truth’, the goal of this session is to analyze the tradeoffs between transparency and certification at the microlevel of a blockchain or at the upper level of decentralized education and knowledge production.
