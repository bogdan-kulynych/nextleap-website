Colloated with EuroS&P and Eurocrypt 2016. Today, the security and privacy properties of blockchain technologies are still an emerging field that is need of further research. The Bitcoin electronic cash system introduced the new field of blockchain technology as a practical mechanism for a permissionless and censorship-resistant e-cash over the Internet. However, the decentralized network and public verifiability of Bitcoin often do not provide the security and privacy properties assumed by its users. For example, despite a common assumption that Bitcoin is anonymous, transactions can be de-anonymized, limiting the commercial utility of the network and also harms individual privacy. Generalizations of Bitcoin's underlying blockchain technology as a platform for smart contracts by Ethereum are still immature. For example, security issues in the underlying programming language for smart contracts in Ethereum led to the massive DAO Hack. More than ever, proper security and privacy properties need to be designed into the underlying framework for blockchain technologies.
