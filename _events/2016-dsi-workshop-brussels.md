Vincent Puig (IRI) attended this workshop of presentation of CAPS Project. The afternoon discussion group about
several technologies such as the blockchain, Libre Office, Owncloud, Etherpad, KDEN Live (Alternative to Premi√®re), ABC (Attribute Based Credentials), and others was fruitful and provided input to the European Commission on the importance of supporting decentralized, open source, and free software.
