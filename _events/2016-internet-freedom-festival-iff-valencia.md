Max Wiehle (Merlinux) went to this annual convention of activists and programmers and led a workshop on how to fight vandalism in Wikis and other collaborative contexts. A particularly interesting discussion came about with Debian developer and cryptographer Daniel Kahn Gillmor and Marios Isaakidis (UCL) on how a provider/server can prove that a client initiated a key change to deflect false “I didn’t submit this key” accusations. The IFF also helped NEXTLEAP to get a better picture of end-user use cases. The audience and participants included activists, researchers, trainers, journalists and social scientists. This diversity made it very clear that the use cases depend heavily on the community in question.
