NEXTLEAP researchers participated in giving a large two-hour session on [Autocrypt](https://autocrypt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which discussed community, useability, protocol and implementation aspects of bringing email encryption to a wider audience. About 70 people attended the session including many major implementors and people involved in the e2e email encryption space. Several conversations and new co-operations ensued.
