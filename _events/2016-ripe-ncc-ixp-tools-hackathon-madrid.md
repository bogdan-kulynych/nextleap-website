These hackathons are made to bring together developers, operators and designers to come up with creative new tools and visualisations that benefit the entire Internet community. With people from CAIDA, Forth and AMS-IX Marios Isaakidis worked on "The Remote Peering Jedi". The purpose of the project was to detect unreported remote peerings so as to make the IXP peer selection process more transparent.
