How do people represent "secure communications"? How do they represent an "adversary"? What can we learn about crypto from visual forms? This session is based on my ongoing collection of 50+ drawings from around the world representing encryption, key exchange, security flaws, surveillance, MITM and so on. I collected drawings done by a variety of folks: from high-risk activists from Ukraine, Russia, Middle East to well-know cryptographers, journalists or security experts.
