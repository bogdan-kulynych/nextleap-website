#### THE NEW INDUSTRIAL WORLD FORUM 2017



##### « ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE / ARTIFICIAL STUPIDITY »

19-20 december 2017, Grande salle du Centre Pompidou

*In collaboration with European project NextLeap, ANR project Epistémè and Plaine Commune’s Chaire de Recherche Contributive*


Within the scope of a global reflection on a new articulation of data processing within the data economy (reticulated artificial intelligence, deep learning, machine learning in general and intensive calculus), on one hand, and of the interpretation of this data and these processes, on the other hand, and within the present scientific context as well as within the exercising of citizenship and more generally of responsibility, this eleventh edition of the New Industrial World Forum intends to analyse the impact of scientific instruments on the constitution of academic knowledge in a time when the technologies stemming from mathematics, as applied to computer science and networks, tend to establish themselves in all domains on the basis of efficiency criteria prescribed by the markets.
