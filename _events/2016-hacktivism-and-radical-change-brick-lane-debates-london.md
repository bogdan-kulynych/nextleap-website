This event attended by Marios Isaakidis (UCL) was a participatory discussion about hacktivism as a way to protest for social or political goals. On the basis of the fact that hacktivism is often misunderstood and overlooked, the purpose of the debate was to explore how persecution of hacktivists affects other campaigns and how citizens and other activists can show solidarity. Prominent activists such as Lauri Love, Privacy International researcher Eva Blum- Dumontet and Oliver Shykles from Queer Friends of Chelsea Manning participated.
