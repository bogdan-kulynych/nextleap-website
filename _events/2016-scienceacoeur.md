This ‘Open source’ discussion between Francesca Musiani and the cryptographer Ludovic Perret was animated by a journalist.

Abstract: Access to all kinds of data and the ability to collect and exploit them have now reached an unprecedented level. We are facing a unique paradox: we have to give thought to the issues of both access to data and data protection, with an emphasis on personal data protection. How does cryptology - then the science of secrecy, now a science based on trust - evolve, in today’s and tomorrow’s contexts? How should individuals now adapt their behaviours?”
