NEXTLEAP's members Ksenia Ermoshina, Harry Halpin and Francesca Musiani will present their joint paper "Can Johnny build a protocol? Co-ordinating developer and user intentions for privacy-enhanced secure messaging protocols" at the 2nd European Workshop on Usable Security. The paper gives an overview of some common protocol design questions facing developers of secure messaging protocols and tests the competing understandings of these questions using STS-inspired interviews with the designers of popular secure messaging protocols ranging from older protocols like PGP and XMPP+OTR to newer unstandardized protocols used in Signal and Briar. Far from taking users as a homogeneous and undifferentiated mass, the paper distinguishes between the low-risk users that appear in most usability studies (such as university students in the USA and Europe) and high-risk activist user-bases in countries such as Ukraine, Iran, Russia and Egypt where securing messages can be a matter of life or death.
