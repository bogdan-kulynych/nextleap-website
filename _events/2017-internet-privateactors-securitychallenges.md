##### International workshop ANR / UTIC

 
In the first of three conferences to be held over the next year, Didier Bigo (CERI-Sciences Po), Laurent Bonelli (ISP-Paris-10 Nanterre) and Sebastien-Yves Laurent (CMRP-Bordeaux) from the ANR project UTIC are bringing together representatives of major online service providers for a high-level experts roundtable.
Participants will look at the ways in which technology firms engage with policy-makers and law enforcement agencies to address today's major security challenges: How did their relationship with intelligence and law enforcement agencies evolve amidst heated post-Snowden debates on surveillance and privacy? What are the main legal hurdles faced by online service providers to protect the rights of their users, and what changes in legislation are called for? How do these companies adapt their business practices to help address today's security challenges? 
By looking at these important issues at the intersection of policy, law and technology, the roundtable will analyse public-private relationships in the fields of surveillance and security, offering an opportunity for a much-needed discussion between key international stakeholders and researchers. 
To facilitate the discussion, the roundtable will be divided in two parts during which representatives of leading Internet companies will share their insights in interaction with researchers. The audience will have an opportunity to join the discussion during Q&A sessions.
