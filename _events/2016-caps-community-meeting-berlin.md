Holger Krekel (Merlinux) attended this gathering of CAPS-related EU projects and interested parties. He
gave an impromptu overview on aspects of NEXTLEAP and thereafter enjoyed fruitful discussions with Stravroula Maglavera from the MAZI project (offline communication infrastructures for physical communities) and with Renato Lo Cigno from the NETCOMMONS project (network infrastructure as commons). They gathered interest in arranging another meet-up to exchange research, development and community insights and tools.
