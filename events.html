<h3>IEEE Security and Privacy on the Blockchain Workshop - 29 April 2017 - Paris</h3>
<img src="img/variable/inriaParis.jpg" class="eventPhoto" alt="" />
<p>Colloated with EuroS&P and Eurocrypt 2016. Today, the security and privacy properties of blockchain technologies are still an emerging field that is need of further research. The Bitcoin electronic cash system introduced the new field of blockchain technology as a practical mechanism for a permissionless and censorship-resistant e-cash over the Internet. However, the decentralized network and public verifiability of Bitcoin often do not provide the security and privacy properties assumed by its users. For example, despite a common assumption that Bitcoin is anonymous, transactions can be de-anonymized, limiting the commercial utility of the network and also harms individual privacy. Generalizations of Bitcoin's underlying blockchain technology as a platform for smart contracts by Ethereum are still immature. For example, security issues in the underlying programming language for smart contracts in Ethereum led to the massive DAO Hack. More than ever, proper security and privacy properties need to be designed into the underlying framework for blockchain technologies. <strong><a href="http://prosecco.gforge.inria.fr/ieee-blockchain2016/">More information</a></strong></p>

<h3>Sciences à coeur - 1 December 2016 - Paris</h3>
<p>This ‘Open source’ discussion between Francesca Musiani and the cryptographer Ludovic Perret was animated by a journalist.</p>
<p>Abstract: Access to all kinds of data and the ability to collect and exploit them have now reached an unprecedented level. We are facing a unique paradox: we have to give thought to the issues of both access to data and data protection, with an emphasis on personal data protection. How does cryptology -  then the science of secrecy, now a science based on trust - evolve, in today’s and tomorrow’s contexts? How should individuals now adapt their behaviours?”</p>

<h3>W3C Blockchains and the Web Workshop - 29-30 July 2016 - Cambridge</h3>
<img src="img/variable/mitMediaLab.jpg" class="eventPhoto" alt="" />
<p>When we talk about blockchains as “part of the Web”, we face some specific questions: How does this fit into the same origin security model of the Web? What are the privacy implications, especially when talking about identity management? What part of the Web stack would be involved: client-side, server-side, protocols, interchange formats? What is the relationship to payments, including W3C's Web Payments work? <strong><a href="https://www.w3.org/2016/04/blockchain-workshop/">More information</a></strong></p>
