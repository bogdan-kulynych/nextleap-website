  In order to be decentralized, secure messaging requires an ability to discover key material and guarantee its integrity. Typically, today this is done via a single centralized and unstandardised service provider. In order to create an interoperable standard around secure messaging, key discovery needs to be decentralized. We've designed a new protocol, <a href="https://claimchain.github.io/">ClaimChain</a>, that builds on both existing work on blockchains while adding new optimizations. We have both experimental Python code and a formally verified version of the code.
