  The goal of this part of the project is understand and popularize the emerging idea of net rights, as pioneered by the idea of a "magna carta" for the Web by Tim Berners-Lee. To achieve that aim, we set up a contributive categorization on Net Rights  to collect previous contributions on Net Rights and related systems. Afterwards, we will in combination with an MOOC (online course), discuss the ethics these net rights with a global audience.

## Privacy-Preserving Federated Identity Management using Algebraic MACs

UnlimitID is a method for enhancing the privacy of commodity OAuth and applications such as OpenID Connect, using anonymous attribute-based credentials based on algebrai Message Authentication Codes (aMACs). OAuth is one of the most widely used protocols on the Web, but it exposes each of the requests of a user for data by each relying party (RP) to the identity provider (IdP). Our approach allows for the creation of multiple persistent and unlinkable pseudo-identities and requires no change in the deployed code of relying parties, only in identity providers and the client.
